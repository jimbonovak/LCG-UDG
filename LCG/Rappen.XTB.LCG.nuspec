Version 1.2023.2.1

#79 Handling bugs in the metadata, some should be `IsLogical` but isn't.
#85 Better filtering options for Attributes and Relationships

---

Version 1.2021.12.1

Fixes:
#72: Load old project with one-file-per-entity gets include config with every file (not supported)
#73: Load sometime fails for no project

---

Version 1.2021.1.2

Major improvement!
Configuration will now by default be stored inline in the generated C# file as a comment block in at the end of the file.
This makes the "project file" obsolete, and a generated C# file can be opened by Latebound Constants Generator and the configuration is parsed from the comment block.

Also:
Simplify Save and Generate behavior, not prompting all the time (#66)
Better handling of identifier strings to ensure compilable results (#70)
Fixed crash when opening configuration containing entities not in the database (#57)

---

Version 1.2020.2.1:

Hide entities, attributes and relationships grids when nothing matches filter (#47)
Disable entire Project menu when no subitems are enabled (#46)
Uncheck all attributes and relationships when unchecking an entity (#49)
Relationship type filters improved (#44)
Filter to exclude various CDS "internal" attributes (#53)
Sorting relationships by type, related entity, and lookup in the UI (#54)
Moved settings to separate dialog (#9)
Possibile to select which relationships to include
Major project refactoring to fit UDG features in a common library

---

Version 1.2019.12.2:

#35 Fixed primary key issue with logical attributes, thanks @maerger!
#38 Fixed de-duplication routine that was confused by comment lines
Fixed issue with Common Class when including relationships

---

Version 1.2019.6.2:

#30 Enum texts containing [ or ] now created correctly. Thanks to @DerekHAu!
#33 Add option to include logical attributes
This will make "non-real" attributes like owneridname and address fields on contact and account etc available.

---

Version 1.2019.5.2:

#22 Many-to-Many relationships included
#26 EntityCollectionName included
#27 CLI support for build automation
#29 Exposing file template for customization of generated file
Rebranded with 2019 design

* NOTE! #26 introduces a breaking change where constant EntityName is changed to LogicalName. This can be reverted with the introduction of #29.

---

Version 1.2018.9.2:

#16 Generate constants for relationships
#21 Option to create separate common class for attributes used by multiple entities
#19 Improved CamelCasing
#24 Add XML documentation for relationship constants
#25 Gently forgive file write errors instead of throwing exception
Template line break bug fixed
